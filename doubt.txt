    print:function(city, country){
        console.log(`name is ${this.name} age ${this.age} and city ${city} and country ${country}`);
    }
}

let obj2 = {
    name:"sharma",
    age:19
};

// bom provides these according to their call

// methods for borrowing a function from other function
// call method to borrow a function from other function
obj1.print.call(obj2,"bangalore","india"); 
//aaply method pass extra argument inside array
obj1.print.apply(obj2,["mumbai","India"]);
//bind method pass instance/copy that create a new same function in space that we have to call using iife to use it
obj1.print.bind(obj2,"greater noida","India")();

// BOM provides and decides these method according to their uses
